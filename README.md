# Deadlock Simulation and Detection

## It's a program that simulates the execution of multiple processes with respect to their resource allocation and resource release requests, and detect when (or if) deadlock occurs. If deadlock occurs, the program will then display a list of the processes and resources involved in the deadlock.
